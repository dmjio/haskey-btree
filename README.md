B+-tree implementation in Haskell.

This package provides two B+-tree implementations. The first one is a pure
B+-tree of a specific order, while the second one is an impure one backed
by a page allocator.

This project is part of the [haskey](https://github.com/haskell-haskey/haskey)
project. The [haskey](https://github.com/haskell-haskey/haskey) repository
contains more information on how to use this library.
